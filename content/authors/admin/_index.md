I am a research engineer at Rephrase.ai, where I work on developing tech which generates videos from just text. I recently graduated from IIT Roorkee with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I am broadly in Deep Learning, with applications in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.


During my undergrad days, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Hanspeter Pfister and Dr. Donglai Wei at Harvard University, Prof. Venkatesh Babu’s group at Indian Institute of Science, and Prof. Marco Pedersoli and Prof. Jose Dolz at École de Technologie Supérieure. I was also the Vice-Chair of ACM IIT Roorkee Student Chapter, and co-led a Deep Learning reading group named the [Vision and Language Group](https://vlgiitr.github.io)


Apart from AI, I am enthusiastic about financial markets, guitar, food, and movies.
